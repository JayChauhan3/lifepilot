🧨 THE WINNING UI STRUCTURE (High-Level)

Your app needs only 5 main pages:

⸻

1️⃣ Dashboard — The Command Center (HOME PAGE)

This is where the judges will spend the most time. It MUST feel magical.

UI Sections:

A. “Pilot Summary” — Top Hero Section

Shows:
	•	“Good Evening, Jay 👋”
	•	Your goal for today: “Focus: Work blocks, hydration, and workout.”
	•	A small summary generated by the Planner Agent:
	•	✔ Day fully planned
	•	✔ Tasks synced
	•	✔ Weather checked
	•	✔ Alerts scheduled

This alone makes it feel alive & intelligent.

⸻

B. Today’s Plan — Clean Timetable View

Timeline blocks:
	•	8:00 am — Morning Routine
	•	9:00 am — Deep Work Block
	•	11:30 am — Gym (based on your preferences)
	•	2:00 pm — Lunch + Shopping List
	•	5:00 pm — Project Work
	•	9:00 pm — Relax Wind Down

Each block should have:
	•	Icon
	•	Short description
	•	Tag (auto-generated / manual)

⸻

C. Task Board (Mini Kanban)

Columns:
	•	Today
	•	Upcoming
	•	Done

Tasks are automatically inserted by Task Executor Agent.

⸻

D. Smart Insights (Analyzer Agent)

Charts + AI messages like:

📊 “Your productivity was highest at 10–12 AM.”
📉 “You slept 1 hour less than your usual pattern.”
⚡ “You completed 74% of last week’s goals.”

Make this section beautiful but simple.

⸻

🔔 E. Notifications

Small side panel:
	•	Reminders
	•	Deadlines soon
	•	Routine loop agent outputs

⸻

This Dashboard will WOW the judges.

⸻

2️⃣ The Planner Page — “Talk to Your Chief of Staff”

This is basically a chat UI but with structure.

Layout:

Left: Chat messages
Right: Agent Actions Panel (very important)

When user types:

“Plan my whole day with workout + meals + product design work.”

The right panel should show:

✔ Planner Agent → Breaking tasks
✔ Knowledge Agent → Fetching weather
✔ Routine Agent → Syncing
✔ Memory Agent → Updating preferences
✔ Task Executor → Adding tasks

Each agent shows a card animation like “processing → done”
Judges LOVE seeing the agent chain visually.

⸻

3️⃣ Tasks & Routines Page

Clear 2-section layout:

A. Tasks Page
	•	Kanban board (Today / Upcoming / Done)
	•	Add Task button
	•	Filters (priority, tags)
	•	Auto-generated tasks labeled with ⚡ “AI”

B. Routines Page

Cards for:
	•	Morning Routine
	•	Sleep Routine
	•	Work Block Routine
	•	Health Routine
	•	Study Routine

Each routine shows:
	•	Next trigger time
	•	Last run
	•	Button: “Run Now”
	•	Button: “Edit Routine”

This page shows the power of the Loop Agent.

⸻

4️⃣ Insights Page (Analyzer Agent)

✔ Weekly Productivity Score

✔ Habit consistency

✔ Sleep time pattern

✔ Task completion rate

Simple clean charts. One line chart for productivity, bar chart for tasks.

🎨 THE VISUAL DESIGN STYLE

To win:

🔥 Clean
🔥 Google-style
🔥 Light mode
🔥 Lots of white space
🔥 Soft shadows
🔥 Emoji-based icons

🔥 Clear agent labels like:

“🚀 Task Executor Agent Completed: Added 3 tasks”

This helps judges FEEL the multi-agent system.

⸻

🧩 HOW TO DISPLAY AGENT FEATURES (THE BEST WAY)

Every time an agent does something, the UI should show a small badge or log:
	•	“Planner Agent: Created 5 subtasks”
	•	“Knowledge Agent: Weather checked 29°C”
	•	“Memory Agent: Updated wake time”
	•	“Routine Agent: Triggered morning routine”
	•	“Task Executor Agent: Added 3 tasks to Today”

This transparency is what judges want.
